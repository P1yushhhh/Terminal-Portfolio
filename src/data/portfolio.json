 "about": [
  "Hi! I'm Piyush, a 4th-year Electronics and Computer Science student at Thapar Institute of Engineering who believes the best way to learn is by shipping.",
  
  "I've freelanced across ML, cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity forensics, blockchain, and data scienceâ€”often jumping into domains I knew nothing about and delivering results that stuck. From building MLOps pipelines on AWS to analyzing security incidents on blue teams, I've learned that strong fundamentals (DSA, system design, OOP) and AI-powered problem-solving beat prior experience every time.",
  
  "My sweet spot? Backend architecture, MLOps, and cloud infrastructure. I love designing systems that scale, automating workflows that shouldn't be manual, and debugging things that 'definitely worked yesterday.'",
  
  "Previously led product at AIESEC India, coordinating 100+ international participants while building operational efficiency that actually moved metrics. Now I'm focused on landing an SDE role where I can build, break, and optimize production systems.",
  
  "When I'm not coding, I'm either gaming, cooking elaborate meals on my hostel room electric pan (Gordon Ramsay would be horrified)"
